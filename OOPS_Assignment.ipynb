        "**OOPS Assignment Theory Questions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. Objects are instance of the classes which contains data(attributes) and behavior(methods) inside them. OOP aims to solve real world problems by making code reusable and easier to maintain. It has four main pillars - Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction and Inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> I class is like a blueprint or template for creating object or some real world entity. In class, we define the methods and attributes to show the behavior of object.\n",
        "For example -\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "   def __init__(self):\n",
        "       pass\n",
        "\n",
        "   def bark(self):\n",
        "       pass\n",
        "   def run(self):\n",
        "       pass\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> An object is the instance of the class. An object resembles the real entity for which a class is created which defines the behavior and attribute of the object. For example, object of above class is created like -\n",
        "```\n",
        "my_dog = Dog()     #creating object of the class Dog\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "- Abstraction is used to hide the implementation details and shows only the essential feature which can be used. Like a person only want to withdraw cash from ATM and don't need to know how it is working internally. It is achieved in Python using @abstractmethod on the method.\n",
        "- Encapsulation is used to hide data from the external component. If we don't want to allow external entity to modify our data then we bind data and methods into single component (in class). It can be achieved using private and protected variables concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Dunder Methods are also called magic or special methods in python. It has name sorrounded under double underscore (__init__, __str__ etc). They enables the built-in behavior for objects and allow customization of operations like initialization, string representation, addition, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Inheritance is used to inherit the property of parent class into Child class. Using inheritance, A child can use all the methods of parent class inside child class. Syntax -\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Vehicle:\n",
        "    def start(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Vehicle is starting...\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
        "    def drive(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Car is driving...\")\n",
        "\n",
        "my_car = Car()\n",
        "my_car.start()  # Inherits method from parent, output -> Vehicle is starting...\n",
        "my_car.drive()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> It allows a single method or operator to behave differently based on the context. We can achieve this behavior using Method overriding and method overloading.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):       # Overriding parent method\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "my_dog = Dog()\n",
        "my_dog.sound()     # It will print 'Dog barks' because it overrides Animal\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In python, encapsulation is achieved using private variable.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class BankAccount:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self.__balance = 0   # Private variable\n",
        "\n",
        "my_bank = BankAccount()\n",
        "my_bank.balance   # It will throw error because balance cannot be accessed outside class\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A constructor is used for object creation of the class. A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created.\n",
        "It is defined using __init__() in python.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "- A class method belongs to class and it cannot be modified or called using object. It can be directly called using \"ClassName.<method-name>\". It is defined using @classmethod on the method and take cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "- A static method is a method that does not depend on the class or instance. It behaves like a regular function but resides inside the class for logical cases.\n",
        "It is defined using @staticmethod on the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Method Overloading means a single object will act different in certain differrent cases. Like '+' will act as addition for two integers but concatenation for two strings.\n",
        "In true sense, it is not supported by Python but, we can achieve it using default arguments.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Example:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, a=None, b=None):\n",
        "        if a is not None and b is not None:\n",
        "            print(f\"Two arguments: {a}, {b}\")\n",
        "        elif a is not None:\n",
        "            print(f\"One argument: {a}\")\n",
        "        else:\n",
        "            print(\"No arguments\")\n",
        "\n",
        "obj1 = Example()           # No arguments will be printed\n",
        "obj2 = Example(10)         # One argument will be printed\n",
        "obj3 = Example(10, 20)     # Two arguments will be printed\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Method Overriding is the process of overriding method behaviour of Parent Class method inside child class by redifining it. It can be achieved using Inheritance.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):       # Overriding parent method\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "my_dog = Dog()\n",
        "my_dog.sound()     # It will print 'Dog barks' because it overrides Animal\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The @property decorator in Python is used to define getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes in a Pythonic way. It enables the power of accessing attributes directly instead of calling methods explicitly.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Circle:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "        self._radius = radius\n",
        "\n",
        "    @property\n",
        "    def area(self):  # Getter method\n",
        "        return 3.14 * self._radius * self._radius\n",
        "\n",
        "c = Circle(5)\n",
        "print(c.area)       # Output: 78.5\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.\n",
        "  - It promotes code reusability, means a single method can be used by multiples object. Like, a area method can be used to calculate area of different shapes.\n",
        "  - Polymorphism helps reduce complexity by allowing a single interface for multiple behaviors, making code easier to read, test, and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "**15. What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be subclassed. It serves as a template for other classes, enforcing certain methods to be implemented in derived (child) classes.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Animal(ABC):            # Abstract class\n",
        "    @abstractmethod\n",
        "    def make_sound(self):     # Abstract method\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "\n",
        "my_animal = Animal()     # Results into an error, object cannot be created\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**16. What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "- Code is organized into objects and classes and hence, it looks modular.\n",
        "- Code reusability can be achieved using Inheritance.\n",
        "- Security can be promoted using Encapsulation.\n",
        "- It is much easy to maintain and scale for addition of new features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "- A class variable is the class member which can be directly accessed using class. It will be same for all the instances.\n",
        "- An instance variable is solely attached to each instance separately. It's value can be different for each object. You can only access instance variable by creating instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> When a child class inherits from two or more superclasses then this mechanism is called multiple inheritance. Unlike Java, python supports multiple inheritance and solve the Diamond problem using Method Resolution Order Algorithm using C3 Linearization.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Class A\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class B:\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Class B\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class C(A, B):        # Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "obj = C()\n",
        "obj.show()            # Output: Class A (Based on MRO)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**19. Explain the purpose of __ str __ and __ repr __  methods in Python?**\n",
        "- __ str __ provides a human-readable (informal) string representation of the object. It is intended for end-users to understand the output clearly.\n",
        "- __ repr __ provides an official string representation of the object that is more formal and unambiguous. It is intended for developers and debugging purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?**\n",
        "-> The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent or sibling class in the context of inheritance.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",

        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        super().speak()               # Calls the parent class method\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "d = Dog()\n",
        "d.speak()    # it print 'Animal speaks' then Dog barks\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**21. What is the significance of the __ del __ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The __ del __ method in Python is a special (dunder) method that is known as a destructor. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. This method allows you to define cleanup actions before the object is removed from memory, such as closing files, releasing resources, or performing other housekeeping tasks.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Object created\")\n",

        "del obj          # `__del__` is called here when object is deleted\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?**\n",
        "- A classmethod is used when the method needs access to the class itself (via cls) rather than an instance of the class. The first argument of a class method is always the class itself (cls).\n",
        "- A staticmethod is used when the method does not need access to either the instance (self) or the class (cls). A static method does not take a special first argument (no self or cls).\n",
        "\n",
        "**23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In python, polymorphism with inheritance can achieved using method overriding. In this case, a single method of Parent class can be overriden in Child class. When we call parent class method using instance of parent class then it works on the basis that how it is defined in parent class. If we call the same method by creating instance of child class then it executes that how it is overriden in child.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",

        "**24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Method chaining in Python (and object-oriented programming in general) refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code. Like - car.add_feature(\"Sunroof\").set_color(\"Red\").add_feature(\"Leather seats\").show_details()\n",
        "\n",
        "**25. What is the purpose of the __ call __ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In Python, the __ call __ method is a special method that allows an object to be called like a function. When an instance of a class is called as if it were a function, Python looks for the __ call __ method and invokes it."
