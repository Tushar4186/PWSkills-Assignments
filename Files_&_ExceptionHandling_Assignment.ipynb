        "\n",
        "**1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
        "*   A compiler is used to compiled the code into machine code before execution. Complete code will be compiled into Machine code which is based on Hardware configuration. For example - Java, C++ etc., uses a compiler.\n",
        "*   Code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime. There is no compilation steps is involved. Python uses an interpreter for execution and errors will be only identified at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Exception Handling is required to resolve the issue of abruptly termination of python program. In Python, we use try and except block to handle the exception. We put all the suspicious code in try block and if exception happen then we catch it in except block and handles it. This way, program will not terminate and proceed to next part of execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Code implemented in finally will always be executed, no matter exception happens or not. Hence, finally block is defined for writing cleanup process code or closing opened resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Logging is used to record the flow or state of our program. It is very helpful for debugging pupose. It also shows how our program is responding at runtime. In python, we use logging library to implement logging in our application.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What is the significance of the __ del __ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method, which is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows you to define cleanup actions, such as releasing resources or closing file connections, before the object is garbage collected.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Example:\n",
        "    def __del__(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Object is being destroyed\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?**\n",
        "- \"import\" is used to import entire module into your code.\n",
        "- \"from ... import\" imports specific components (functions, classes, or variables) directly from a module.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n",
        "-> In Python, we can handle multiple exceptions using multiple excepts. For example -\n",
        "```\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "    result = 10 / x\n",
        "except ValueError:\n",
        "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number.\")\n",
        "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "    print(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
        "except Exception as e:\n",
        "    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The with statement in Python is primarily used to simplify file handling by managing resources like file streams automatically. It ensures that files are properly opened and closed, even if an exception occurs during processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In Python, multithreading and multiprocessing are two approaches used to achieve concurrent execution.\n",
        "- Multithreading is a technique where multiple threads (smaller units of a process) run concurrently within the same process.\n",
        "- Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes, each with its own memory space and Python interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Using logging in a program offers several advantages, making it an essential practice for monitoring, debugging, and maintaining software.\n",
        "- Provides detailed information about errors and program execution, helping developers trace issues efficiently.\n",
        "- Allows developers to set different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to control the granularity of logs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Memory management in Python refers to the process of allocating, tracking, and releasing memory used by Python programs. It ensures efficient use of memory resources while preventing memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In Python, exception handling is implemented using the try-except block to handle runtime errors gracefully without crashing the program.\n",
        "- Place the code that might raise an exception inside a try block.\n",
        "- Use one or more except blocks to catch specific or generic exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Memory management is crucial in Python because it ensures efficient allocation, utilization, and deallocation of memory resources, enabling programs to run smoothly without consuming excessive memory or crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The try and except blocks in Python are used for exception handling to catch and manage runtime errors gracefully, ensuring the program does not crash.\n",
        "```\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "    result = 10 / num\n",
        "except ValueError:\n",
        "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n",
        "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "    print(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**15.  How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Python's garbage collection system is responsible for automatically managing memory by detecting and cleaning up unused objects, ensuring efficient memory usage and preventing memory leaks. The system is primarily based on two mechanisms: reference counting and cyclic garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In Python, the else block in exception handling is used to specify code that should be executed only if no exception was raised in the try block. If the code inside the try block runs without any errors, the else block will be executed. This is useful for writing code that should only run when the normal execution (without exceptions) occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**17. What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",
        "- DEBUG: Detailed diagnostic messages for development.\n",
        "- INFO: General operational messages.\n",
        "- WARNING: Indicates a potential issue or something that could become problematic.\n",
        "- ERROR: Logs errors that impact a specific function or action.\n",
        "- CRITICAL: Logs severe errors that could halt the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "**18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?**\n",
        "- os.fork() is a system call in Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) that creates a child process by duplicating the current process. The child process is a copy of the parent process, and it starts executing from the point where os.fork() was called.\n",
        "- The multiprocessing module provides a higher-level interface for creating and managing child processes. It works across platforms, including both Unix-based systems and Windows.\n",
        "\n",
        "**19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",
        "- File handles and memory buffers are limited system resources. When you open a file, the operating system allocates resources (like file descriptors) to manage it. If you do not close the file, these resources remain tied up, potentially leading to resource leaks.\n",
        "- When you write to a file, the data is often buffered in memory before being written to the disk. This means the changes might not immediately be written to the file. If you don't close the file properly, the buffered data might not be flushed to disk, leading to data loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "**20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?**\n",
        "- file.read() - Reads the entire content of a file (or a specified number of bytes) into a single string.\n",
        "- file.readline() - file.readline() reads the next line from the file, including the newline character (\\n) at the end of the line.\n",
        "\n",
        "**21. What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The logging module in Python is used for tracking and recording log messages from a program. It allows developers to write log entries for their applications, which can be helpful for debugging, monitoring, error reporting, and auditing. The logging system in Python provides a flexible way to log messages of different severity levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error, and critical).\n",
        "\n",
        "**22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system, offering a variety of functions for file and directory management, including creating, removing, and manipulating files and directories. It is often used in file handling when you need to interact with the underlying filesystem or perform OS-specific operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
        "- Unpredictability: The garbage collector runs periodically and might not immediately reclaim memory for unused objects. This can lead to increased memory consumption at certain points in time.\n",
        "- Uncollected Garbage: Objects that are no longer in use may not be cleaned up due to reference cycles or incorrect usage of objects, causing memory to accumulate over time.\n",
        "- Python's memory allocator manages memory in blocks. Over time, as objects are created and destroyed, the memory layout may become fragmented, making it harder to allocate larger objects even when there is enough free memory overall.\n",
        "\n",
        "**24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In Python, you can raise an exception manually using the raise statement. This is useful when you want to signal that something has gone wrong in your program or when a specific condition is met.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "# Raising a custom exception\n",
        "raise MyCustomError(\"This is a custom error\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Multithreading is important in certain applications because it allows multiple tasks or operations to be performed concurrently, taking advantage of modern multi-core processors. By dividing a program into multiple threads that can run simultaneously, multithreading can improve the performance, responsiveness, and efficiency of applications, especially for tasks that are I/O-bound or involve concurrent tasks.\n",
